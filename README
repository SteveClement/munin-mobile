Munin Mobile
By: Niklas Bivald

INTRODUCTION
Munin Mobile is a mobile template for Munin, using jquery-mobile. This allows 
your Munin installations to be easily monitored with your smartphone. 

Munin Mobile is initially made for the Munin debian package (1.2.6). Currently 
I haven't tested any other versions.  

Both Munin Mobile and jquery-mobile are a bit rough (jQuery Mobile is alpha!)
and before you tell me that this could be made without jQuery Mobile using just
special CSS: Yes, it could. But this is just as much exploring jQuery Mobile
as it is exploring Munin.

We're hooking into munin-html with a custom configuration file, hopefully making 
it as "Munin-friendly" as possible. 

INSTALL
Assuming you have the standard debian package (/etc/munin, /var/www/munin) you 
*should* just be able to run the ./install.sh script. This will install templates 
and configuration file (which you might want to check out)

We also need to make Munin create the job that regularly updates the HTML. In the 
future we will hook it into Munin itself, but for now, use this crontab from your 
Munin user:

* * * * * /usr/share/munin/munin-html --config=/etc/munin/munin-mobile.conf

After installation, you should have a mobile-subfolder in your munin 
(yourdomain.com/munin/mobile). Also, the CSS/JS right now assumes you have 
munin in a subfolder (yourdomain.com/munin). This will be fixed in upcoming releases.
